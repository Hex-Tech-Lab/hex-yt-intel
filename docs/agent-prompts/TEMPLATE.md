# Agent Dispatch Prompt — <TASK_NAME>

**Target Agent**: <AGY-1 (Flash) (OpenCode) (Pro) AGY-2 OC |>
**Effort Level**: <high | medium | low>

## 0. Ledger protocol — [ALWAYS INCLUDE — DO NOT PARAPHRASE OR SUMMARIZE]

> **Follow `AGENTS.md` §5 "SHARED COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL" in full — it is the
> canonical, authoritative version, not summarized here to avoid drift.**
> Read it now if you haven't already. In short: read `.memory/AGENT_LEDGER.md`
> AND `.memory/ADRS.md` before touching any file; post `[IN_PROGRESS]` with
> intent + target files as your first action; re-check the ledger after every
> subtask; post `[DONE]`/`[PARTIAL]`/`[BLOCKED]` with a real summary of what
> actually happened (not what you intended) as your last action; use the
> `[NOTE]`/`[ACK]`/`[DISPUTE]`/`[RESOLVED]` flow for cross-agent corrections.

## 3. Pre-PR Review Skills Decision Tree (MANDATORY GATE)

> **ENFORCEMENT**: Match touched files against the tree below. Execute ALL
> matching skills before CI/PR. Document findings under `### Skills Run +
> Findings`. **Every name below is a real, installed skill or a real external
> tool this repo's CI actually runs — verified against the live skill listing
> and `gh pr view --json statusCheckRollup` on 2026-09-05, after a prior
> version of this template was found to reference 14 skill names that do not
> exist anywhere in this environment (`fe-state-auditor`, `accessibility-a11y`,
> `bundle-analyzer`, `api-route-guard`, `worker-port-adapter-audit`,
> `idempotency-check`, `sentry-privacy-auditor`, `webhook-signature-verifier`,
> `secret-scanner`, `entity-canonicalizer`, `transcript-pipeline-audit`,
> `prompt-boundary-guard`, `monorepo-path-linter`, `ledger-protocol-auditor`).
> Do not add a skill name to this file without confirming it exists in the
> live `Skill` tool listing first.**

- **STEP 0 — before any Grep/Glob/Read (token-savings, always first)**:
  - `build-graph` (rebuilds/updates `.code-review-graph/graph.db`), then use
    its query surface — `query_graph_tool`, `get_impact_radius_tool`,
    `get_affected_flows_tool`, `detect_changes_tool`, `get_review_context_tool`
    — to scope blast radius before reading whole files. If the graph MCP is
    not connected this session, note that explicitly and fall back to the
    project-local `explore-codebase` / `review-pr` / `review-delta` /
    `review-changes` / `debug-issue` / `refactor-safely` skills instead of
    silently skipping this step.

- **ALWAYS (all PRs)**:
  - `qa-intel` — run in **both** `--diff` and `--full` mode (never trust one
    mode's "clean" result alone — standing project rule).
  - `code-reviewer` — correctness/maintainability/contract-gap review.
  - `simplify` — reuse/simplification/efficiency/altitude pass, applies fixes.
  - `review-delta` — token-efficient delta review with blast-radius detection.
  - `review-duplication` — scan for reinvented utilities / duplicated logic.
  - `contract-auditor`: `pnpm exec tsx web/scripts/contract-auditor.ts` — strict Zod `safeParse`, retain typed `.data`, flag raw pass-throughs.

- **IF `web/components/**` | `web/hooks/**` | `web/app/**` (FE / UI)**:
  - `react-best-practices` — hook deps, stale closures, hydration, layout stability, bundle size.
  - `composition-patterns` — boolean-prop proliferation, compound-component / render-prop opportunities.
  - `web-design-guidelines` — accessibility, UX compliance, Web Interface Guidelines.
  - `react-view-transitions` — IF the diff adds page/route transitions or enter/exit/list-reorder animations.

- **IF `worker/**` | `web/app/api/**` | `*ports*` | `*adapters*` (BE / API)**:
  - `owasp-top-10` — IF the diff adds an external fetch, auth/signature path, secret/credential handling, or a new webhook/API entrypoint.
  - `race-condition-guard` — IF the diff mutates shared state under concurrency (webhooks, queues, workers, double-submit-prone endpoints) — TOCTOU/check-then-act/idempotency.
  - pr-review-toolkit plugin: `silent-failure-hunter` — IF the diff touches error handling / catch blocks (same bug class as qa-intel's ErrorTaxonomyRule, narrower focus).
  - pr-review-toolkit plugin: `type-design-analyzer` — IF the diff changes TypeScript type/interface shapes.

- **IF `*billing*` | `*Paddle*` | `middleware/**` | `auth/**` (Security / Billing)**:
  - `owasp-top-10` — parameter injection, broken access control, CORS, input sanitization.
  - `race-condition-guard` — webhook redelivery / out-of-order-event races (real finding class, see PaddleBillingAdapter TOCTOU, 2026-09-05 audit).
  - `database-sentinel` — IF the change touches credential handling, RLS, or auth bypass surfaces.

- **IF `supabase/migrations/**` | new table/index | raw SQL/query change**:
  - `supabase-postgres-best-practices` — query/index/lock patterns.
  - `supabase` — broader: RLS, Auth, Edge Functions, Realtime, Storage, pg_cron/pg_vector.
  - `database-sentinel` — RLS/rules misconfiguration, exposed credentials, auth-bypass audit.
  - `db-arch-10x` — heavier structural audit; invoke when the diff is migration-heavy, adds >1 table/relationship, or the user explicitly asks for a schema audit (not on every small migration).
  - **Mandatory sub-check whenever a migration creates or replaces a function**: verify `REVOKE EXECUTE ... FROM anon, authenticated, public` is present unless the function is genuinely meant to be client-callable, AND that any ownership/authorization check inside a `SECURITY DEFINER` function checks the actual role (`auth.jwt() ->> 'role'`) rather than inferring service-role from `auth.uid() IS NULL` (real fail-open IDOR found this way, 2026-09-05 audit, `get_temporal_subgraph`). Verify live via `select grantee, privilege_type from information_schema.routine_privileges where routine_name = '<fn>'` after applying — don't just trust the SQL text.
  - `planetscale-postgres-safety-review` is **NOT applicable to this repo** (wrong DB platform — Supabase Postgres, not PlanetScale). Do not invoke.

- **IF `scripts/**` | `.memory/**` | `*.config.*` | `.*ignore` (Monorepo / CI)**:
  - `qa-intel` — `pnpm dlx tsx scripts/verify-quality-engine.ts --ci --compare` (also run in `--full` mode per the ALWAYS rule above).
  - pr-review-toolkit plugin: `comment-analyzer` + `pr-test-analyzer` — PR description/test-coverage sanity.

- **High-stakes / genuinely contested decisions ONLY (not a per-PR gate)**:
  - `llm-council` — architecture-level forks or business-tradeoff calls. Ask the user full 13-advisor vs. scaled-down 5-advisor mode before invoking.
  - `stress-test` — Verbalized Sampling to challenge a conclusion when confidence in the merge decision itself feels shaky.

- **Suspected Vercel cost/perf regression (new route, new data-fetch pattern, bundle growth)**:
  - `vercel-optimize` — metrics-first (needs Observability Plus), not code-only guessing.

- **Explicitly NOT installed / do not reference as available**: `webapp-testing`, `agent-browser` (confirmed absent, not stubs). `code-modernization` plugin exists but is scoped to legacy COBOL/.NET-Framework migrations — wrong shape for this stack, do not enable for routine review.

## 4. Verification & Quality Gates (local)

```bash
pnpm --filter @hex-yt-intel/web exec tsc --noEmit
pnpm --filter youtube-intelligence-worker exec tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.typecheck.json
pnpm --filter @hex-yt-intel/web exec vitest run
pnpm --filter @hex-yt-intel/web lint
pnpm dlx tsx scripts/verify-quality-engine.ts --ci --compare
pnpm exec tsx web/scripts/contract-auditor.ts
```

## 4b. External CI / Tool Stack (runs automatically once PR is opened — verify, don't assume)

Confirmed live on this repo via `gh pr view <n> --json statusCheckRollup` (2026-09-05, PR #286):
`Cubic` (AI code reviewer — architecture/pattern), `CodeRabbit` (logic/edge-case review), `Snyk`
(dependency security), `DeepSource` (JS/Shell/Secrets static analysis), `CodeQL` (2 workflows:
"CodeQL" and "CodeQL - Code Quality" — javascript-typescript/python/actions), `OSSAR`, `Codacy
Static Code Analysis`, `Sourcery review`, `Vercel` (preview deploy), `Netlify` (deploy-preview +
header/redirect/pages checks — also live on this repo, not previously documented anywhere in
this file), `Supabase Preview` (branch preview — note: shows `SKIPPED` on PRs where branch
previews aren't provisioned; do not treat a SKIPPED Supabase Preview as a passed migration
check — it means the migration was NOT dry-run automatically, verify manually).

**Before merge, use the discovery check to confirm which of these actually ran and passed —
never assume the full stack fired just because the PR opened**:
```bash
gh pr view <n> --json statusCheckRollup | jq '.statusCheckRollup[] | .name // .context, .conclusion // .state'
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/code-scanning/alerts?state=open | jq 'length'
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/dependabot/alerts?state=open | jq 'length'
```
A missing gate (e.g. Cubic absent from the rollup entirely) is itself a finding — see PR #270
(2026-08-26), which merged without Cubic and shipped a real TOCTOU bug that gate class exists to
catch. Do not merge on a missing required gate without an explicit, logged waiver.

## 5. The Three Tenets — [ALWAYS INCLUDE — DO NOT PARAPHRASE OR SUMMARIZE]

> 1. **Contract definition + enforcement.** State the exact input→output
> contract for what you're building BEFORE writing it.
> 2. **E2E cycle complete, input to output, across the ENTIRE chain.**
> 3. **Tangent hunt as you walk the workflow.**

## 6. Report Format — [ALWAYS INCLUDE — DO NOT PARAPHRASE OR SUMMARIZE]

> RCA → Contract → Fix → E2E proof (with actual test output) → Tangents found → Deviations flagged → Skills Run + Findings → Gates → Files changed.
