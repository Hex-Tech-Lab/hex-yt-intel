# RELAUNCH (correction, run 2 of 2) — read this block first; the full original prompt follows below.

Your previous run did steps 1-4 correctly: it rebased onto ff8e0231, wrote `worker/src/__tests__/jev-plan-route.test.ts` (6 passing, now STAGED), ran negative controls (5/4/1 fail) and the full worker suite (322 pass). Do NOT redo or rewrite these. It ENDED because it wrote to `/tmp` (forbidden; the run is killed by a rejected tool call). Use `<worktree>/.scratch/` for ALL output files.

Remaining work, in order:
1. Run `pnpm dlx tsx scripts/verify-quality-engine.ts --ci --compare > .scratch/qa.json 2>&1` (launch dir is ~/projects; pass paths under the worktree). It currently reports 8 new findings: unclear names 'p' and 'r', LF-only split, 2x truncation without ellipsis, catch without logging, 2x non-null assertion after sort/filter. For each, note the file. Fix the ones in `jev-plan-route.test.ts`. For any in `worker/src/routes/analysis.ts`, fix them ONLY if the fix doesn't change behavior; otherwise list them in the report.
2. Re-run the 6 route tests and the full worker suite. Then `git add`, re-run qa-intel, and confirm it exits 0 / "No new issues".
3. Commit `test(worker): R3b 2.3W — route-level tests for plan event ordering, /plan fallback, projective skip`, `git push --force-with-lease`, ledger [DONE]. Do not un-draft.

# Agent Dispatch Prompt — R3b 2.3W route-level tests for PR #392

> **Before filling in Target Agent/Effort below**: check CLAUDE.md's
> "Model/task-fit routing" table — UI/grunt-level work → AGY Flash, no/low
> effort; multi-hop or long-horizon work → a non-Flash tier (AGY Pro / Claude
> / OC on a stronger model); narrow well-scoped fix → OC's cheap default.
> That table decays fast (model landscape moves monthly) — if this task is
> non-trivial or expensive, skim `.memory/AGENT_LEDGER.md` for a recent real
> outcome on a similar task shape before trusting the table blindly.

**Target Agent**: OC
**Effort Level**: medium

> **Before dispatching**: run the `improve-prompt` skill against the filled-in
> prompt below. It mechanizes this file's own Model-tuning rule and report
> contract as a checklist — cheaper than re-deriving them from memory each
> time, and catches drift the way this template's own history shows prose
> reminders alone don't.

## 0. Ledger protocol — [ALWAYS INCLUDE — DO NOT PARAPHRASE OR SUMMARIZE]

> **Follow `AGENTS.md` §5 "SHARED COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL" in full — it is the
> canonical, authoritative version, not summarized here to avoid drift.**
> Read it now if you haven't already. In short: read `.memory/AGENT_LEDGER.md`
> AND `.memory/ADRS.md` before touching any file; post `[IN_PROGRESS]` with
> intent + target files as your first action; re-check the ledger after every
> subtask; post `[DONE]`/`[PARTIAL]`/`[BLOCKED]` with a real summary of what
> actually happened (not what you intended) as your last action; use the
> `[NOTE]`/`[ACK]`/`[DISPUTE]`/`[RESOLVED]` flow for cross-agent corrections.
>
> This is not optional bookkeeping: skipping it has previously caused two
> agents to collide on the same checkout with mixed uncommitted diffs
> (2026-08-03), and this exact template was created because a dispatched
> prompt omitted this instruction and the ledger post only happened after
> the user manually told the agent to follow protocol (2026-08-06).

## Model-tuning rule — [ALWAYS APPLY, not a section to copy-paste]

**A "flash"/low-effort-tier model (AGY on Gemini Flash low, OC on GLM-5.3-flash (CoreWeave, reasoning low — see CLAUDE.md "OC model standard")) does not reliably execute prose *principles* — it executes
literal, numbered, sequential *steps*.** Stating "do contract-def, E2E, and
tangent-hunt" once as a paragraph is not enough at this tier; the model will
often satisfy the injection/entry-site case and stop, treating the
downstream chain and adjacent files as implicitly covered when they were
never actually checked. Confirmed twice on 2026-08-07: an OC dispatch that
explicitly demanded "E2E proof, not code-reading confidence" in prose still
shipped a fix backed only by a unit-test-expectation change, and a Cubic
re-review caught a real ordering-invariant gap the agent's own report never
surfaced.

Before writing sections 1–2 below, decide:
- **Small, single-file task?** One dispatch is fine, but still phrase the
  Three Tenets (section 5) as a literal numbered checklist scoped to the
  exact files/functions involved — not the generic prose block.
- **Touches more than ~2 files, or needs investigation + fix + PR?** Split
  into sequential, separately-dispatched prompts (investigate → fix →
  verify/PR), each narrowly scoped, rather than one prompt bundling all
  three. A dense 40-line prompt for one focused step beats a 200-line
  prompt covering three steps at once — length is not the lever,
  specificity per step is.
- **Requires `/pr-review-workflow`, a specific branch, or a specific PR
  number?** Name them explicitly and literally in section 2 ("create branch
  `fix/xyz`", "invoke the `/pr-review-workflow` skill", "target PR #NNN") —
  never phrase it as "follow the usual review process."

## 1. Context & Problem Statement

Worktree `/home/kellyb_dev/projects/hex-yt-intel-r3b-23w`, branch `feat/r3b-2-3w-worker-plan` (PR #392, DRAFT). Home dir `/home/kellyb_dev` (UNDERSCORE).

Hard rules: work ONLY in your worktree; never `cd` (use `pnpm --filter ...` / `git -C`); `.scratch/` only, never /tmp; never git checkout/restore/stash on uncommitted work (negative controls: `cp file .scratch/x.bak`, break, test, `cp` back); never delete, weaken or overwrite an existing test; never run `pnpm qa-intel:baseline` or edit `.qa-intel/baseline.json`; qa-intel AFTER `git add`, and it must print "No new issues since baseline" with N>0 files scanned.

PR #392 adds `/plan` resolution plus an `event: plan` SSE frame to `worker/src/routes/analysis.ts` (section starting ~L858: `isValidJevPlan`, the `/plan` fetch with K=1 fallback, and the plan emitter ~L1184). Its only tests (`worker/src/__tests__/jev-plan-worker.test.ts`) cover HELPERS. Nothing proves the ROUTE's behavior. No existing worker test drives the analysis route end to end, so you must build a minimal harness: call the Hono app/route handler with a `Request`, stub `globalThis.fetch` (vi.stubGlobal/vi.spyOn) so you can tell `/api/analyses/<id>/plan` calls apart from OpenRouter calls, and read the SSE response body as text. Use `worker/src/__tests__/stream-token-dual-verify.test.ts` to see how to mint a valid stream token.

The branch is BEHIND origin/main (missing #391 and #393). Rebase first.

## 2. Contract & Implementation Directives

1. Ledger [IN_PROGRESS] (worktree ledger).
2. `git -C <wt> fetch origin && git -C <wt> rebase origin/main`. On a conflict in `.memory/*`, take origin/main's version and re-append your ledger line. Any conflict in code: STOP and report [BLOCKED].
3. Create `worker/src/__tests__/jev-plan-route.test.ts` with these route-level tests (each asserts on the real SSE response body and on the recorded fetch calls):
   a. Grounded bundle, no `jevPlan` in the request, `/plan` returns a valid plan → the body contains exactly one `event: plan` frame, and it comes BEFORE the first grounded token/data frame (compare string indexes). Its `data` matches the contract `{v:1,source:"worker",K,streamCount,cells,...}`.
   b. `/plan` returns 500 → one `event: plan` with K=1, AND the OpenRouter call still happens, AND tokens still stream.
   c. `/plan` times out/rejects → same as (b).
   d. `/plan` returns 200 with bad JSON / a malformed plan → same as (b).
   e. Request body carries a valid `jevPlan` → NO `/plan` fetch; the plan frame has source "inline".
   f. Projective bundles (bundle 9 and bundle 11, use the real bundle ids from the code) → NO `/plan` fetch and NO `event: plan` in the body.
4. Negative controls (back up via `.scratch/`, break, run, restore, rerun green). Record the failing count for each:
   - Move the plan emission after the first token → (a) fails.
   - Make a `/plan` failure throw instead of falling back → (b)-(d) fail.
   - Drop the projective guard → (f) fails.
5. Gates: `pnpm --filter youtube-intelligence-worker exec tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.typecheck.json`; `pnpm --filter youtube-intelligence-worker exec vitest run` (full worker suite); qa-intel after `git add` (`pnpm dlx tsx scripts/verify-quality-engine.ts --ci --compare`; do NOT run `--mode full`, it runs out of memory on this machine).
6. Commit `test(worker): R3b 2.3W — route-level tests for plan event ordering, /plan fallback, projective skip`, then `git push --force-with-lease`. Do NOT un-draft or merge. Ledger [DONE] with actual test output + negative-control counts.

Out of scope: any change to `worker/src/routes/analysis.ts` behavior. If a test reveals a real bug, do NOT fix it: report it, with the failing test left in `.skip` and a comment explaining why.

## 3. Pre-PR Review Skills Decision Tree (MANDATORY GATE)

> **ENFORCEMENT**: Match touched files against the tree below. Execute ALL
> matching skills before CI/PR. Document findings under `### Skills Run +
> Findings`. **Every name below is a real, installed skill or a real external
> tool this repo's CI actually runs — verified against the live skill listing
> and `gh pr view --json statusCheckRollup` on 2026-09-05, after a prior
> version of this template was found to reference 14 skill names that do not
> exist anywhere in this environment (`fe-state-auditor`, `accessibility-a11y`,
> `bundle-analyzer`, `api-route-guard`, `worker-port-adapter-audit`,
> `idempotency-check`, `sentry-privacy-auditor`, `webhook-signature-verifier`,
> `secret-scanner`, `entity-canonicalizer`, `transcript-pipeline-audit`,
> `prompt-boundary-guard`, `monorepo-path-linter`, `ledger-protocol-auditor`).
> Do not add a skill name to this file without confirming it exists in the
> live `Skill` tool listing first.**
>
> **SELECT is re-evaluated continuously, not decided once at dispatch.** CORE
> is fixed by design — it never changes regardless of what the task touches.
> SELECT exists specifically because the diff's real footprint isn't always
> known upfront: a task that starts in `web/components/**` can legitimately
> land in `supabase/migrations/**` once you follow the actual fix. **Every
> time the touched-file set grows beyond what it was when you last matched
> against this tree — a tangent, a new file, scope discovered mid-task — re-run
> the IF-matching below against the new file set before continuing.** Treating
> SELECT as a one-time decision at the top of the task is the single most
> likely way a real skill goes unrun: the file that would have triggered it

> the final report's `### Skills Run + Findings` section with what triggered
> the re-check ("touched `supabase/migrations/*.sql` mid-task, added
> `supabase-postgres-best-practices` + `database-sentinel`"), not silently.

- **STEP 0 — before any Grep/Glob/Read (token-savings, always first)**:
  - `build-graph` (rebuilds/updates `.code-review-graph/graph.db`), then use
    its query surface — `query_graph_tool`, `get_impact_radius_tool`,
    `get_affected_flows_tool`, `detect_changes_tool`, `get_review_context_tool`
    — to scope blast radius before reading whole files. If the graph MCP is
    not connected this session, note that explicitly and fall back to the
    project-local `explore-codebase` / `review-pr` / `review-delta` /
    `review-changes` / `debug-issue` / `refactor-safely` skills instead of
    silently skipping this step.

- **ALWAYS (all PRs)**:
  - `qa-intel` — run in **both** `--mode diff` and `--mode full` (never trust
    one mode's "clean" result alone — standing project rule; verified real
    CLI flags against `scripts/verify-quality-engine.ts`'s own `--help`
    output and `package.json`'s `qa-intel`/`qa-intel:ci`/`qa-intel:baseline`
    scripts on 2026-09-05 — the flags are `--mode <diff|full|watch|
    working-tree|HEAD>` and `--compare`, NOT bare `--diff`/`--full`).
  - `code-reviewer` — correctness/maintainability/contract-gap review.
  - `simplify` — reuse/simplification/efficiency/altitude pass, applies fixes.
  - `review-delta` — token-efficient delta review with blast-radius detection.
  - `review-duplication` — scan for reinvented utilities / duplicated logic.
  - `contract-auditor`: `pnpm exec tsx web/scripts/contract-auditor.ts` — flags raw boundary pass-throughs and unvalidated payloads (grep/AST based — its name notwithstanding, it contains no Zod `safeParse` call; see the script).

- **IF `web/components/**` | `web/hooks/**` | `web/app/**` (FE / UI)**:
  - `react-best-practices` — hook deps, stale closures, hydration, layout stability, bundle size.
  - `composition-patterns` — boolean-prop proliferation, compound-component / render-prop opportunities.
  - `web-design-guidelines` — accessibility, UX compliance, Web Interface Guidelines.
  - `react-view-transitions` — IF the diff adds page/route transitions or enter/exit/list-reorder animations.

- **IF `worker/**` | `web/app/api/**` | `*ports*` | `*adapters*` (BE / API)**:
  - `owasp-top-10` — IF the diff adds an external fetch, auth/signature path, secret/credential handling, or a new webhook/API entrypoint.
  - `race-condition-guard` — IF the diff mutates shared state under concurrency (webhooks, queues, workers, double-submit-prone endpoints) — TOCTOU/check-then-act/idempotency.
  - pr-review-toolkit plugin: `silent-failure-hunter` — IF the diff touches error handling / catch blocks (same bug class as qa-intel's ErrorTaxonomyRule, narrower focus).
  - pr-review-toolkit plugin: `type-design-analyzer` — IF the diff changes TypeScript type/interface shapes.

- **IF `*billing*` | `*Paddle*` | `middleware/**` | `auth/**` (Security / Billing)**:
  - `owasp-top-10` — parameter injection, broken access control, CORS, input sanitization.
  - `race-condition-guard` — webhook redelivery / out-of-order-event races (real finding class, see PaddleBillingAdapter TOCTOU, 2026-09-05 audit).
  - `database-sentinel` — IF the change touches credential handling, RLS, or auth bypass surfaces.

- **IF `supabase/migrations/**` | new table/index | raw SQL/query change**:
  - `supabase-postgres-best-practices` — query/index/lock patterns.
  - `supabase` — broader: RLS, Auth, Edge Functions, Realtime, Storage, pg_cron/pg_vector.
  - `database-sentinel` — RLS/rules misconfiguration, exposed credentials, auth-bypass audit.
  - `db-arch-10x` — heavier structural audit; invoke when the diff is migration-heavy, adds >1 table/relationship, or the user explicitly asks for a schema audit (not on every small migration).
  - **Mandatory sub-check whenever a migration creates or replaces a function**: verify `REVOKE EXECUTE ... FROM anon, authenticated, public` is present unless the function is genuinely meant to be client-callable, AND that any ownership/authorization check inside a `SECURITY DEFINER` function checks the actual role (`auth.jwt() ->> 'role'`) rather than inferring service-role from `auth.uid() IS NULL` (real fail-open IDOR found this way, 2026-09-05 audit, `get_temporal_subgraph`). Verify live via `select grantee, privilege_type from information_schema.routine_privileges where routine_name = '<fn>'` after applying — don't just trust the SQL text.
  - `planetscale-postgres-safety-review` is **NOT applicable to this repo** (wrong DB platform — Supabase Postgres, not PlanetScale). Do not invoke.

- **IF `scripts/**` | `.memory/**` | `*.config.*` | `.*ignore` (Monorepo / CI)**:
  - `qa-intel` — `pnpm dlx tsx scripts/verify-quality-engine.ts --ci --compare` (also run in `--full` mode per the ALWAYS rule above).
  - pr-review-toolkit plugin: `comment-analyzer` + `pr-test-analyzer` — PR description/test-coverage sanity.

- **High-stakes / genuinely contested decisions ONLY (not a per-PR gate)**:
  - `llm-council` — architecture-level forks or business-tradeoff calls. Ask the user full 13-advisor vs. scaled-down 5-advisor mode before invoking.
  - `stress-test` — Verbalized Sampling to challenge a conclusion when confidence in the merge decision itself feels shaky.

- **Suspected Vercel cost/perf regression (new route, new data-fetch pattern, bundle growth)**:
  - `vercel-optimize` — metrics-first (needs Observability Plus), not code-only guessing.

- **Explicitly NOT installed / do not reference as available**: `webapp-testing`, `agent-browser` (confirmed absent, not stubs). `code-modernization` plugin exists but is scoped to legacy COBOL/.NET-Framework migrations — wrong shape for this stack, do not enable for routine review.

## 4a. Verification & Quality Gates (local)

```bash
pnpm --filter @hex-yt-intel/web exec tsc --noEmit
pnpm --filter youtube-intelligence-worker exec tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.typecheck.json
pnpm --filter @hex-yt-intel/web exec vitest run
pnpm --filter @hex-yt-intel/web lint
pnpm dlx tsx scripts/verify-quality-engine.ts --ci --compare
pnpm exec tsx web/scripts/contract-auditor.ts
```

## 4b. External CI / Tool Stack (runs automatically once PR is opened — verify, don't assume)

Confirmed live on this repo via `gh pr view <n> --json statusCheckRollup` (2026-09-05, PR #286):
`Cubic` (AI code reviewer — architecture/pattern), `CodeRabbit` (logic/edge-case review), `Snyk`
(dependency security), `DeepSource` (JS/Shell/Secrets static analysis), `CodeQL` (2 workflows:
"CodeQL" and "CodeQL - Code Quality" — javascript-typescript/python/actions), `OSSAR`, `Codacy
Static Code Analysis`, `Sourcery review`, `Vercel` (preview deploy), `Netlify` (deploy-preview +
header/redirect/pages checks — also live on this repo, not previously documented anywhere in
this file), `Supabase Preview` (branch preview — note: shows `SKIPPED` on PRs where branch
previews aren't provisioned; do not treat a SKIPPED Supabase Preview as a passed migration
check — it means the migration was NOT dry-run automatically, verify manually).

**Before merge, use the discovery check to confirm which of these actually ran and passed —
never assume the full stack fired just because the PR opened**:
```bash
gh pr view <n> --json statusCheckRollup | jq '.statusCheckRollup[] | .name // .context, .conclusion // .state'
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/code-scanning/alerts?state=open | jq 'length'
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/dependabot/alerts?state=open | jq 'length'
```
A missing gate (e.g. Cubic absent from the rollup entirely) is itself a finding — see PR #270
(2026-08-26), which merged without Cubic and shipped a real TOCTOU bug that gate class exists to
catch. Do not merge on a missing required gate without an explicit, logged waiver.
